I specify a kind of persistence for links to be put on a slot, a temporary variable or a class variable.  

I can be of kind: 
- #read only read nodes
- #write only assignment nodes 
- #all both

I know the class of the slot/var the link will be put on. I also know my link, although several versions of me can exist for the same link, but with different targets (slots/var).
